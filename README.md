# MATLAB demo for a bandgap imaging technique

This is the MSTLAB demo for the paper: Imaging Spatial Variations of Optical Bandgaps in Perovskite Solar Cells, published on the Advanced Energy Materials in 2018. We have developed a fast, nondestructive, camera‐based method to capture optical bandgap images of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with micrometer‐scale spatial resolution.
